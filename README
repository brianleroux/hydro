Hydro 
=====
Rehydrating micro applications. (Offline virtual environment and package management for JavaScript.)


Features
--------
- create virtual environments of JavaScript libraries you define 
- library and dependency free 
- utilizes localStorage but any underlying store is easily swapped in
- super tiny so it will load fast using HTML5 cache manifest


Why
---
HTML5 adds a new attribute to the html element called manifest wherein you define a static file that lists urls of static files you wish to cache. This is cool, however, the implementation is currently a little buggy and does not provide a method for inspecting or modifying the cache contents. That's cool though, it gives us enough to cache hydro itself which can then take care of caching the rest of your application. 


Example usage
-------------
// in your index.html file add this attribute: <html manifest="hydro.manifest"> 

// something like this in an onLoad event to create a profile
var environment = new Hydro({ manifest:'app-manifest.js' });

// simple-manifest.js
{
	// the virtual environment profile to be loaded
	"current":"0.0.1",

	// available virtual environments profiles
	"profiles":{
		"0.0.1":[
		   	{"name":"xui", "url":"../src/js/lib/xui-min.js"},
				{"name":"fail", "url":"exists-it-does-not.js"}
		]
	}
}
